# DrawingBoard
This is a simple JavaFX-DrawingBoard-App based on JavaFX.

Go and check out the JavaFX-Library [here](https://openjfx.io/ "JavaFX"). Since it is not included in the Java-SDK by default, you have to get it on this page. Follow its instructions for installation and usage with Eclipse and IntelliJ.
